        <p class="pclass1">I'm currently in my third year at the <span class="highlight">University of California, Irvine</span>, majoring in Computer Science and complementing it with a minor in English. Additionally, I serve as a Student Research Assistant under the mentorship of Professor Marco Levarato in the esteemed <span class="highlight">Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences</span>. Our focus lies at the intersection of <span class="highlight">Augmented Reality and Machine Learning</span>.</p>
        <p class="pclass1">Some languages I have been growing and learning with are:</p>
        <ul class="list1">
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pclass1">I'm an avid reader and writer, enjoying the nuanced articulation of ideas that English literature offers. My leisure hours are often spent curating Spotify playlists, where I creatively align tracks with various moods and themes. Beyond this, I take pleasure in personalizing my surroundings and belongings, infusing them with a unique touch that reflects my individuality. This could be as simple as customizing my electronic devices or organizing my living space to mirror my personal style.</p>
